\section{Introduction}
Navigating large code bases is an essential skill for software developers to have.
There are many tools that help developers navigate code bases such as code editors like CLion and PyCharm \cite{jetbrains}, and Google's Code Search \cite{googlecodesearch}. There are different aspects of code bases that a developer may be interested in and there are various tools available for each of them. This project proposes a visualization tool to navigate code bases using a tree visualization of the directory structure. The interactive tree visualization can be further used by the programmer to query information on the files and directories. This project focuses on the version control aspect of code bases.
