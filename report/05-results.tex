\section{Results}
Over the course of this semester I was able to implement the font and back end for rendering the graph and loading different git repositories. This includes the methods discussed in the research section \ref{sec:research}. The project overall gave me an idea on how to handle large graph data and experiment with different UI setups to make it easy for the client to explore the graph.

The next step would be implement the front end for running the queries.
