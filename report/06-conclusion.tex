\section{Conclusion}

The goal of this project is to allow the developer to explore a code base and the git version control system associated with it. With the current implementation the developer will need to load a separate window with a web application, which can be inconvenient as the application is not part of the general workflow. A better way to implement this tool would be as a vs code extension. This is possible as vs code extensions are able to run web applications inside them with the help of a webview \cite{vscodewebview}. For future work, I would like to begin using Microsoft's webview tool kit \cite{vscodewebviewtoolkit} to convert this into an extension. The changes would include getting rid of the material file tree and using vs code editor's file tree instead. This would make it easy for developers to run this tool in a familiar environment. The key takeaways from this project were the libraries and softwares used to bring it together.
